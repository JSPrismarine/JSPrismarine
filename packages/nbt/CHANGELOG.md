### Patch Changes

- [#2577](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2577) [`6b60a88`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/6b60a88e40ad9751ea177f4273779869486de7e0) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Move JSBinaryUtils into the monorepo as `@jsprismarine/binaryutils`.
  
  It was developed in its own repository and consumed here as a pinned npm dependency, which meant a
  change to the binary stream needed a release there before it could be used here. It now lives in
  `packages/binaryutils` and every consumer resolves it through the workspace, so it builds, typechecks
  and tests together with the packages that use it.
  
  The published name changes: `@jsprismarine/jsbinaryutils` is deprecated on npm and its last release
  re-exports this package, so existing installs keep working. The API is unchanged.
  
  Two things came along with the jump from the pinned 5.5.3 to current: `write()` accepted a
  `Uint8Array` in its signature but called `Buffer#copy` on it, so anything not already a `Buffer`
  threw at runtime — it now uses `set`. And the single internal `buffer` field is split into a read and
  a write buffer, so code reaching past the public API to assign `.buffer` no longer populates the read
  side; use `setReadBuffer()`.
  
  `@jsprismarine/protocol` also gained the dependency in its manifest — it imported the package while
  relying on it being hoisted into the root `node_modules`.

- [#2579](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2579) [`b6c3d73`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/b6c3d73168fa0397205e20fcbf3cc19c4d0bac36) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Remove constructs that ahead-of-time compilation with scriptc cannot lower, keeping runtime behavior the same.
  
  - `@jsprismarine/bedrock-data` exports `creativeitems` from a generated, explicitly typed module (`CreativeItemEntry[]`) instead of the raw JSON.
  - `@jsprismarine/brigadier` keeps each argument builder in the module of the node it builds (the old paths re-export), declares `literal` and `argument` as functions, and its exception types call message factories positionally.
  - `@jsprismarine/errors` declares its `Error` base without a type parameter.
  - `@jsprismarine/math` exposes `Vector2.ZERO` and `Vector3.ZERO` as shared immutable instances, and `Vector3` subclasses keep their class through `withX` and friends by overriding `create`.
  - `@jsprismarine/minecraft` exports `blockSchemas` from a generated, typed module (`BlockSchemaCatalog`).
  - `@jsprismarine/prismarine` replaces the `evt`-based event bus with its own `EventEmitter` (same `on`, `once`, `removeListener`, `removeAllListeners`, `emit` and `post`), carries inventory transaction data as a discriminated union (`kind`), exposes `allBlocks()`, `allItems()` and `allEntities()` registries, and drops the `heap`, `evt`, `fast-jwt` and `confbox` dependencies.
  - `@jsprismarine/raknet` declares `sendPacket` without a type parameter.

- [#2585](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2585) [`6bac604`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/6bac604599b909ba32f93fc855de11e88455d184) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Replace `as` type assertions with inferred types, type guards and narrower parameter types across the packages.
  
  Most of the change is internal, but a few public signatures moved so the compiler can carry the type instead of a cast:
  
  - **brigadier.** `ArgumentType.parse` receives an `ArgumentParseContext<S>` (the dispatcher's context builder, which is what it always got at runtime) instead of a `CommandContext`. `ParseResults.getExceptions()` holds `Error` values, since argument parsers throw plain errors. `CommandContext.getLastChild()` no longer claims it can return `null`. `ArgumentType` and `ArgumentParseContext` are exported from the package root.
  - **protocol.** `DataItem` is built from one `DataItemEntry` whose `type` tag decides the type of `value`, and exposes `getId`, `getType` and `getValue`. `NetworkStructure.deserialize` now returns a real instance: it used to copy the prototype with `Object.assign`, which copies nothing, so a decoded `BlockPos` or `Vec3` had no `serialize` method and failed `instanceof`.
  - **raknet.** `ServerName` takes a `ServerNameSource` naming the two methods it reads instead of `any`.
  - **client.** `ClientPacketRegistry` exports an `isPacket(packet, id)` guard that narrows `DecodedPacket.data` by id. The handshake rejects a JWT claim that is present but not a string with the existing clear error instead of a later `TypeError`.
  - **minecraft.** `BlockSchemaProperty.type` is the union of the three NBT tags the palette uses, so a palette with a new tag fails type-checking instead of slipping through as a string.
  - **prismarine.** The command dispatcher is typed over `CommandExecutor`, with typed `literal`/`argument` builders and runtime-checked argument accessors; selectors and relative coordinates from the console fail with a clear error instead of a `TypeError`, and relative `~` coordinates, which threw on every use, now work. `Metadata` stores typed entries so a value that does not match its `FlagType` is a compile error. Several managers take the narrow slice of `Server` they use (`BanManager`, `BlockManager`, `PacketRegistry`, `RecipeManager`, `CreativeInventory`), so tests build plain doubles. A shorthand ambient module had typed every import from `@jsprismarine/bedrock-data` as `any` inside the package; it is gone, so the generated types reach the compiler.
  - **logger, nbt, leveldb.** No signature changes. `Logger.getNamespace` returns an empty string instead of throwing when `Error.stack` is undefined, and `NBTTagCompound` getters return the default for a tag of the wrong kind instead of throwing.

- [#2577](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2577) [`60e9e6f`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/60e9e6f981cce46edf2bb2ee0b7b1eea3b7360ee) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Fix six encoding bugs that made NBT unusable for anything but the narrow subset the network path happened to exercise, and add the package's first tests.
  
  - `TAG_Short`, `TAG_Int` and `TAG_Long` were written through unsigned writers, which assert on negative input — so writing any negative number threw outright. String byte counts, which really are unsigned, moved to their own reader and writer.
  - Writing a list of any type resolved the element type from `Set.entries()`, whose entries are `[value, value]` pairs, so every list was typed `TAG_Int_Array` and writing one always threw.
  - `TAG_Int_Array` inside a compound was handed to the scalar int writer.
  - `TAG_Byte_Array` inside a list was written as a double.
  - `TAG_Byte` inside a list was read as a short, corrupting both the values and the read cursor.
  - `expectInput` allocated a Buffer view of the entire remaining payload, then rewound, once per tag read.
  
  Block runtime ids are unchanged: for non-negative values the signed and unsigned writers emit identical bytes.

JSON data exports are now typed structurally (`string`, `number`) instead of as literal values.
- Updated dependencies [[`6b60a88`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/6b60a88e40ad9751ea177f4273779869486de7e0), [`ff8648e`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/ff8648e6f92e87f702a1fefc09d306db3307da8a)]:

### Patch Changes

- [`53eb2f6`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/53eb2f605a8a90bee72788ac785fd4046ecce2b2) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Bump Vite to 8.0.12 across the root, every workspace package, and the turbo generator template, and roll in the follow-up fixes needed to keep the codebase happy under Vite 8 (Rolldown):
    - Drop the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin in favor of Vite 8's native `resolve.tsconfigPaths: true` option, rename `build.rollupOptions` to `build.rolldownOptions` in the shared root config, drop the no-longer-supported output options (`hoistTransitiveImports: true`, `indent: false`, `interop: 'auto'`, `validate: true`), and remove the dropped `rollupTypes` option on `vite-plugin-dts`.
    - Untangle the `BuiltInExceptions -> SimpleCommandExceptionType -> CommandSyntaxException -> BuiltInExceptions` module load cycle that Rolldown refused to swallow the way the previous esbuild-based bundler did:
        - Defer `CommandSyntaxException.BUILT_IN_EXCEPTIONS` construction to a lazy getter and wrap every `BuiltInExceptions` static field in a memoized factory so no `new SimpleCommandExceptionType(...)` / `new DynamicCommandExceptionType(...)` runs during the class's static-initialization phase.
        - Add named exports for `SimpleCommandExceptionType` and `DynamicCommandExceptionType` alongside their existing default exports and switch the in-package call sites (`BuiltInExceptions`, `BuiltInExceptionProvider`, the brigadier barrel, and `SimpleCommandSyntaxExceptionType.test.ts`) to the named imports so they side-step Rolldown's stricter default-binding resolution while external default-import call sites keep working unchanged.
    - Hoist `vi.mock('@jsprismarine/raknet', ...)` out of the `describe` block in `Server.test.ts` so vitest stops warning about runtime hoisting (it will become an error in a future vitest release).
    - Replace the `fs.readdirSync` block enumeration in `Block.test.ts` with an eager `import.meta.glob` so vite's `dynamic-import-vars` plugin stops complaining about the missing static file extension.
    - Teach typedoc about the `@todo` block tag (plus the rest of TSDoc's standard tags) via a `blockTags` allow-list in `typedoc.json` so internal todo comments stop emitting "unknown block tag" warnings, and re-point Logger's `@document` to `../../../docs/log-levels.md` so the path resolves from the source file (`packages/logger/src/logger.ts`) up to the repo root's `docs/log-levels.md`.
    - Add `packages/bedrock-data/src/generated/*` to `.prettierignore` so the auto-generated JSON blobs don't trip prettier formatting checks.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4364c2f`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/4364c2fee5b4cc8f8dce04ee3213db3f5a434e4a) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Republish every package with its compiled `dist/` output. The previous stable release shipped without any built code — every tarball on npm contained only `package.json`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE` — because `pnpm run build` had been commented out of the release workflow at the time of the cut. The build step has since been restored; this minor bump forces a fresh stable publish so consumers actually receive the compiled code.

## 0.13.5

### Patch Changes

- [`5a9f6d3`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/5a9f6d3459722aa9fe2d18b225eb939a6ddbca51) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Force-republish all packages at 0.13.4 to recover from a broken release pipeline.

    Previous attempts to publish 0.13.3 left the npm registry in an inconsistent state: a handful of packages (`brigadier`, `client`, `color-parser`, `errors`, `prismarine`, `raknet`) were pushed under the `unstable` dist-tag at the non-snapshot version `0.13.3`, while the rest failed mid-publish. Rather than try to repair 0.13.3 in place, we're skipping it entirely and resyncing every package on `latest` at 0.13.4.
