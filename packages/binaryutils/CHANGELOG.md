# @jsprismarine/binaryutils

## 0.20.0

### Patch Changes

- [#2944](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2944) [`f030c63`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/f030c63e5c6269288d8dc576bddde160eda3cc74) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - `BinaryStream` reads and writes varuint32-length-prefixed values: `readLengthPrefixed` and `writeLengthPrefixed` for bytes, and `readVarString` and `writeVarString` for UTF-8 strings, the form Bedrock writes strings in. `NetworkBinaryStream` in `@jsprismarine/protocol` now inherits them instead of defining its own, so a package that needs Bedrock strings without the protocol package can use them.

### Patch Changes

- [#2890](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2890) [`2ed840e`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/2ed840e8fd0ec1651fbba1bdfb3e2ab728c8bfe1) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - chore(deps): update dependency glob to v13.0.7

- [#2893](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2893) [`2d468b0`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/2d468b068fa56b158a7fe43168368dbef0c49015) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - chore(deps): update dependency vite to v8.3.6

- [#2902](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2902) [`0a03bb6`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/0a03bb69b0c8b11d9432f8f306111b66d7ff3596) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - chore(deps): update dependency glob to v14

- [`cd2a60d`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/cd2a60d428ee7f983601dc0fdf2638bdec7e4fe5) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Name the built files `index.js` and so on instead of `index.es.js`. Every `exports`, `main`, `module` and `bin` path in the packages points at the new names, so a consumer that imports through a package name needs no change; one that reaches into `dist/` by file name has to drop the `.es`.

- [#2577](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2577) [`6b60a88`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/6b60a88e40ad9751ea177f4273779869486de7e0) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Move JSBinaryUtils into the monorepo as `@jsprismarine/binaryutils`.
  
  It was developed in its own repository and consumed here as a pinned npm dependency, which meant a
  change to the binary stream needed a release there before it could be used here. It now lives in
  `packages/binaryutils` and every consumer resolves it through the workspace, so it builds, typechecks
  and tests together with the packages that use it.
  
  The published name changes: `@jsprismarine/jsbinaryutils` is deprecated on npm and its last release
  re-exports this package, so existing installs keep working. The API is unchanged.
  
  Two things came along with the jump from the pinned 5.5.3 to current: `write()` accepted a
  `Uint8Array` in its signature but called `Buffer#copy` on it, so anything not already a `Buffer`
  threw at runtime — it now uses `set`. And the single internal `buffer` field is split into a read and
  a write buffer, so code reaching past the public API to assign `.buffer` no longer populates the read
  side; use `setReadBuffer()`.
  
  `@jsprismarine/protocol` also gained the dependency in its manifest — it imported the package while
  relying on it being hoisted into the root `node_modules`.

- [#2579](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2579) [`ff8648e`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/ff8648e6f92e87f702a1fefc09d306db3307da8a) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Build declaration files with TypeScript 7 through `tsc-ts`. JSON data exports are now typed structurally (`string`, `number`) instead of as literal values.
