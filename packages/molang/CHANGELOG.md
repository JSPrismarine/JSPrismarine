### Patch Changes

- [#2890](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2890) [`2ed840e`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/2ed840e8fd0ec1651fbba1bdfb3e2ab728c8bfe1) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - chore(deps): update dependency glob to v13.0.7

- [#2893](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2893) [`2d468b0`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/2d468b068fa56b158a7fe43168368dbef0c49015) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - chore(deps): update dependency vite to v8.3.6

- [#2902](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2902) [`0a03bb6`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/0a03bb69b0c8b11d9432f8f306111b66d7ff3596) Thanks [@renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)! - chore(deps): update dependency glob to v14

- [`cd2a60d`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/cd2a60d428ee7f983601dc0fdf2638bdec7e4fe5) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Name the built files `index.js` and so on instead of `index.es.js`. Every `exports`, `main`, `module` and `bin` path in the packages points at the new names, so a consumer that imports through a package name needs no change; one that reaches into `dist/` by file name has to drop the `.es`.

### Minor Changes

- [#2661](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2661) [`9061024`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/9061024a45c9e8b00be4963b61406d7474f2f82d) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Remove CommonJS package outputs

### Patch Changes

- [`5d424a0`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/5d424a05c2c9721f9d6a9863949f95d290cc13a5) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Export `MOLANG_EXAMPLES`, ten Molang expressions with the scopes they are shown under and the values they produce, and list them in the README. The test suite checks that they compile cleanly, evaluate as documented and match the README.

### Minor Changes

- [#2628](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/pull/2628) [`db4b039`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/db4b039894d90ab3a7ee6fc700728adadfc678f5) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Add `@jsprismarine/molang`: a Molang parser, compiler and evaluator for Bedrock behavior packs. It
  parses the full grammar with a Pratt parser, compiles each expression once per (source, version)
  into a cached closure over a typed scope, implements the 61 documented `math.*` functions with
  Bedrock's semantics, registers the 21 vanilla server-side queries with their declared contexts, and
  applies the versioned operator precedence rules (ternary associativity at 1.18.10, `&&` over `||`
  and comparison over equality at 1.18.20, the negative-divisor fix at 1.19.60). Unknown identifiers
  are reported through compile diagnostics and evaluate to 0.0 at run time, as the engine does.
