# @jsprismarine/bedrock-data

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4364c2f`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/4364c2fee5b4cc8f8dce04ee3213db3f5a434e4a) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Republish every package with its compiled `dist/` output. The previous stable release shipped without any built code — every tarball on npm contained only `package.json`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE` — because `pnpm run build` had been commented out of the release workflow at the time of the cut. The build step has since been restored; this minor bump forces a fresh stable publish so consumers actually receive the compiled code.

### Patch Changes

- [`0590f70`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/0590f70413e7e8038473c309f1b7c41889f3f6de) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Explicitly update the BedrockData submodule in the release workflow before building so publishes never ship with stale or missing data.

- [`3a6587f`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/3a6587fc1244f84ca9e7bcf1a9f8606d8f08f1d7) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Include `src/generated/**` in turbo build outputs so cache hits restore the JSON files that typedoc needs to resolve `@jsprismarine/bedrock-data` source.

- [`3aa7813`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/3aa78132d3805cefe776d8de835b0b1081ca3095) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Bump TypeScript to 6.0.3 and drop deprecated `downlevelIteration`/`baseUrl` from tsconfigs.

## 0.13.5

### Patch Changes

- [`5a9f6d3`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/5a9f6d3459722aa9fe2d18b225eb939a6ddbca51) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Force-republish all packages at 0.13.4 to recover from a broken release pipeline.

    Previous attempts to publish 0.13.3 left the npm registry in an inconsistent state: a handful of packages (`brigadier`, `client`, `color-parser`, `errors`, `prismarine`, `raknet`) were pushed under the `unstable` dist-tag at the non-snapshot version `0.13.3`, while the rest failed mid-publish. Rather than try to repair 0.13.3 in place, we're skipping it entirely and resyncing every package on `latest` at 0.13.4.
