## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- [`53eb2f6`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/53eb2f605a8a90bee72788ac785fd4046ecce2b2) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Bump Vite to 8.0.12 across the root, every workspace package, and the turbo generator template, and roll in the follow-up fixes needed to keep the codebase happy under Vite 8 (Rolldown):
    - Drop the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin in favour of Vite 8's native `resolve.tsconfigPaths: true` option, rename `build.rollupOptions` to `build.rolldownOptions` in the shared root config, drop the no-longer-supported output options (`hoistTransitiveImports: true`, `indent: false`, `interop: 'auto'`, `validate: true`), and remove the dropped `rollupTypes` option on `vite-plugin-dts`.
    - Untangle the `BuiltInExceptions -> SimpleCommandExceptionType -> CommandSyntaxException -> BuiltInExceptions` module load cycle that Rolldown refused to swallow the way the previous esbuild-based bundler did:
        - Defer `CommandSyntaxException.BUILT_IN_EXCEPTIONS` construction to a lazy getter and wrap every `BuiltInExceptions` static field in a memoized factory so no `new SimpleCommandExceptionType(...)` / `new DynamicCommandExceptionType(...)` runs during the class's static-initialization phase.
        - Add named exports for `SimpleCommandExceptionType` and `DynamicCommandExceptionType` alongside their existing default exports and switch the in-package call sites (`BuiltInExceptions`, `BuiltInExceptionProvider`, the brigadier barrel, and `SimpleCommandSyntaxExceptionType.test.ts`) to the named imports so they side-step Rolldown's stricter default-binding resolution while external default-import call sites keep working unchanged.
    - Hoist `vi.mock('@jsprismarine/raknet', ...)` out of the `describe` block in `Server.test.ts` so vitest stops warning about runtime hoisting (it will become an error in a future vitest release).
    - Replace the `fs.readdirSync` block enumeration in `Block.test.ts` with an eager `import.meta.glob` so vite's `dynamic-import-vars` plugin stops complaining about the missing static file extension.
    - Teach typedoc about the `@todo` block tag (plus the rest of TSDoc's standard tags) via a `blockTags` allow-list in `typedoc.json` so internal todo comments stop emitting "unknown block tag" warnings, and re-point Logger's `@document` to `../../../docs/log-levels.md` so the path resolves from the source file (`packages/logger/src/logger.ts`) up to the repo root's `docs/log-levels.md`.
    - Add `packages/bedrock-data/src/generated/*` to `.prettierignore` so the auto-generated JSON blobs don't trip prettier formatting checks.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [`4364c2f`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/4364c2fee5b4cc8f8dce04ee3213db3f5a434e4a) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Republish every package with its compiled `dist/` output. The previous stable release shipped without any built code — every tarball on npm contained only `package.json`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE` — because `pnpm run build` had been commented out of the release workflow at the time of the cut. The build step has since been restored; this minor bump forces a fresh stable publish so consumers actually receive the compiled code.

### Patch Changes

- [`0590f70`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/0590f70413e7e8038473c309f1b7c41889f3f6de) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Explicitly update the BedrockData submodule in the release workflow before building so publishes never ship with stale or missing data.

- [`3a6587f`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/3a6587fc1244f84ca9e7bcf1a9f8606d8f08f1d7) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Include `src/generated/**` in turbo build outputs so cache hits restore the JSON files that typedoc needs to resolve `@jsprismarine/bedrock-data` source.

- [`3aa7813`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/3aa78132d3805cefe776d8de835b0b1081ca3095) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Bump TypeScript to 6.0.3 and drop deprecated `downlevelIteration`/`baseUrl` from tsconfigs.

## 0.13.5

### Patch Changes

- [`5a9f6d3`](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/commit/5a9f6d3459722aa9fe2d18b225eb939a6ddbca51) Thanks [@filiphsps](https://github.com/filiphsps)! - Force-republish all packages at 0.13.4 to recover from a broken release pipeline.

    Previous attempts to publish 0.13.3 left the npm registry in an inconsistent state: a handful of packages (`brigadier`, `client`, `color-parser`, `errors`, `prismarine`, `raknet`) were pushed under the `unstable` dist-tag at the non-snapshot version `0.13.3`, while the rest failed mid-publish. Rather than try to repair 0.13.3 in place, we're skipping it entirely and resyncing every package on `latest` at 0.13.4.
