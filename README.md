  <div>
    <li id="can-i-contribute-to-the-project">
      <b>Can I contribute to the project?</b>
    </li>
    <p>
    Yes, but before you do so, please read our <a href="https://github.com/AvalanchePowered/Avalanche/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <li>
      <b>Where can I download plugins for Avalanche?</b>
    </li>
    <p>
      Plugins for Avalanche can be downloaded from <a href="https://avalanchepowered.org" target="_blank">our website</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <li>
      <b>I cannot join my Avalanche server through Windows.</b>
    </li>
    <p>
      Windows by default does not allow you to join locally hosted servers through Minecraft, to fix this, run <kbd>CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe"</kbd> through PowerShell as an administrator, then restart your game and try again.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <li>
      <b>What operating systems are supported by Avalanche?</b>
    </li>
    <p>
      In theory, any operating system capable of running Node.js version 16.0.0 of newer should be able to run it, though this is not guaranteed, but you can definitely run Avalanche on Linux, OSX and Windows as they do support Node.js.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <li>
      <b>What devices can I join my Avalanche server using?</b>
    </li>
    <p>
      You can easily join your server using Android, iOS and Windows 10/11. Mojang does not officially support joining external servers on PS4, Xbox One and Switch, but there are methods to workaround this that can be easily found online by doing a little bit of searching.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <li>
      <b>My question was not listed here, what should I do?</b>
    </li>
    <p>
      The easiest method would be joining our <a href="https://discord.gg/6w8JWhy" target="_blank">Discord Guild</a> and asking other people, alternatively you can ask on our <a href="https://avalanchepowered.com" target="_blank">forums</a>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please do not open issues on the GitHub repository for help with running Avalanche unless you experience a bug that doesn't allow you to run it.</span>
