A load-testing harness: N synthetic players against a server, and the numbers they produce.

`Fleet` connects a fleet at a configured rate, ticks each bot's behaviours at the server's own twenty per second, and reports what happened - login latency percentiles, RakNet round trip, bytes and packets per direction, how many of the requested bots actually got in, and what each refusal was. A bot that fails to connect is recorded and left out rather than aborting the run, because "how many of five hundred got in" is usually the question being asked.

Everything random comes from one seed, derived per bot rather than shared. `Math.random` cannot be seeded, and a run that cannot be repeated is not a measurement: two runs against the same server have to differ because the *server* behaved differently. A single generator handed to five hundred bots would have them take turns drawing from one sequence, so what each did would depend on how the others were scheduled - which is the non-determinism the seed exists to remove.

Four behaviours, deliberately separable, because a load test is a question and the question is usually about one kind of traffic: `walk` (chunk streaming and entity tracking), `look` (the broadcast path, without touching streaming), `chat` (fan-out - two hundred bots speaking once each is forty thousand deliveries), and `break` (the three-step action sequence a real client sends).

It lives in `packages/client/src/bot/` rather than in a package of its own: it is under a thousand lines, it depends only on the client, and nothing will ever depend on it.

**A command line, `jsp-client`**, in the same package and for the same reason - the command line is a way of driving the client, not a separate product.

```
jsp-client bot   --host <address> --count <n> [--behaviour walk,chat,break]
                 [--duration 10m] [--ramp 5/s] [--seed 1234] [--view-distance 4]
                 [--report report.json]
jsp-client connect --host <address> [--name Steve]
jsp-client ping    --host <address>
```

Built on `node:util.parseArgs` rather than a dependency: the repository has no argument library anywhere, Node 21 is already the engine requirement, and a binary that has to stay `bun build --compile`-able has every reason not to grow a dependency tree for five flags. A bare `--duration 60` means sixty *seconds*, because the alternative reading wastes an afternoon. It exits 2 for a command line it cannot read and 1 when any bot failed to get in, so it works as a CI gate and not only as something to read.

**Five more packets migrated to `NetworkPacket<T>`** - `MovePlayer`, `PlayerAction`, `RequestChunkRadius`, `ChunkRadiusUpdated` and `LevelChunk` - each pinned against the server's own class byte for byte. Two carry traps worth naming: `MovePlayer`'s length depends on one of its own bytes, since the teleport fields exist only for a teleport, and `PlayerAction` writes its block positions with an *unsigned* y, so writing all three signed encodes every height above 63 one byte differently and the reader takes the block face out of the middle of a coordinate. `LevelChunk` reads its envelope and hands the terrain over unparsed, which is what lets a bot skip the expensive half of the packet that makes up most of a server's output.

Two more bugs the real binary found that the tests could not:

- **Nothing kept the process alive.** Every handle the client owns is `unref`ed so a library never holds its host process open, which in a process whose only job *is* that client leaves nothing holding the event loop. Node exited between the first await and the answer: `ping` printed nothing, the fleet connected nobody, and both returned zero. Invisible under a test runner, which keeps the loop alive by itself.
- **The report's round-trip time was always `-`.** A report is produced after the run ends, and the RTT lived only on a session that had already been torn down, so the number no report ever saw was the one the harness existed to measure. The transport keeps the last live measurement now.

**`ClientSocket.kill` closed its socket one tick too early.** `disconnect` queues a DISCONNECTION_NOTIFICATION and `dgram.send` is asynchronous however immediate the priority was, so closing the handle in the same tick dropped the datagram and the goodbye was never sent. The server then held the session until it timed out - ten seconds counting against the player limit - and a fleet that reconnected found the server full of clients that had already left. Found by the harness itself, on the fifth fleet of a test run.
