The client can log in. `@jsprismarine/client` connects to a Bedrock server, completes the handshake and stands in the world - proved by a test that boots a real `Server` in-process and joins it with nothing mocked in between.

**`@jsprismarine/auth`, new.** The login identity: the JWT chain, the client data blob, and the P-384 key both are signed with. A package of its own because the proxy shares it - it needs to *verify* an incoming chain when acting as a server in online mode, which a client never does. A provider is chosen at the edge of the application, so which one is in play is a deployment decision rather than a build-time one. `OfflineAuthProvider` signs the single self-signed chain link a real client sends when it is not signed in, and generates its key per instance, because the key *is* the identity: five hundred bots under one name still need five hundred of them.

The default skin is generated from flat colour blocks laid over the regions the classic humanoid geometry samples. Mojang's textures cannot be redistributed and a client that refused to log in without one would be useless. It is also not optional in the way it looks: the server builds a `Skin` out of the client data and dereferences eighteen fields without checking any of them, so a client that omits one crashes the login handler rather than being refused.

**Ten packets migrated to `NetworkPacket<T>`** - the ones a join cannot do without. `Login` is among them, and is encodable for the first time: `LoginPacket.encodePayload` had been a commented-out block with a hardcoded chain in it since it was written. `StartGame` is deliberately partial, reading the fields a client cannot function without and stopping; the rest is positional and would have to be modelled in full before any of it could be read. Stopping early is safe because a batch length-delimits each packet.

**`@jsprismarine/client`, rebuilt.** It was a 230-line proof of concept that could not finish a handshake - it hardcoded RakNet protocol 10 against this repository's own 11, drove a *server* session by passing itself as `this as any`, and sent a Login that encoded nothing. It is now a transport seam, a packet registry with no `Server` in the signature, a batching session and a login state machine, and it depends on `@jsprismarine/protocol` rather than on the server.

Three bugs found by pointing it at a real server:

- **Inbound batches were dispatched out of order.** Decoding is asynchronous because inflating runs on libuv's thread pool, so a batch takes as long as its *size* says, and a large one was overtaken by every small one that arrived while it was still inflating. A 37 KiB `StartGame` surfacing after the `PlayStatus` that was meant to follow it is not a slow `StartGame`, it is a missing one - the login failed with "the server spawned us without ever sending StartGame" while the packet was still inflating. Inbound is now a chain, the receiving mirror of the one `MinecraftSession` already kept on the way out.
- **`ResourcePackResponsePacket.encodePayload` could not be read by its own `decodePayload`**: a spare `writeUnsignedShortLE(0)` sat in front of the count. Latent while only the server handled this packet, which decodes and never writes one.
- **`World.getPlayerData` raised "Player has no XUID"** for every unauthenticated player - a case `LoginHandler` explicitly permits, `savePlayerData` has always written a file for, and the very next line already had a fallback for. It logged as an error on every offline join. Reader and writer now share one key.
