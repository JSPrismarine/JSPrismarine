Protocol 2193: Minecraft 1.26.50 and 1.26.51.

Everything that was captured for 1.26.40 was captured again from a Bedrock Dedicated Server 1.26.51.1 - the item table (2076 items), the block palette (1477 blocks, 22079 states: 98 new wool and concrete stairs and slabs, a `minecraft:corner` on every stair, four connection states on every fence, pane and bar) and the recipes (1967) - and three things a 2193 client will not get into the world without were captured for the first time: the jigsaw structure rules, sent as `JigsawStructureDataPacket` before `StartGame` because the client disconnects with `MissingStructureData` otherwise; the definitions of the ninety-eight vanilla blocks that 1.26.50 defines in data, which `StartGamePacket` now declares the way a real server does; and the biome definitions, whose packet stopped being two loose lists and became a map of biome data plus a shared string table - a client reaches the world-generation screen with an empty one and gives up, so the real payload is now replayed. `packages/client/tools/capture-server-data.mjs` records all of them in one login.

This was found the only way it could be: a retail 1.26.51 client reaching the world-generation screen and stalling. The same client also confirmed that, faced with a server that answers NetherNet's `GET /v1/join` signaling probe with a 404, it falls back to a direct RakNet connection - which is the transport this server speaks.

The `LevelChunkPacket` payload wrote its biome sections with the wrong palette header. Each biome sub chunk is a paletted store like the block ones, and its header is `(bitsPerBlock << 1) | networkFlag`; the server wrote `bitsPerBlock 0` but left the network flag clear (`0` instead of `1`), which tells the client the palette is the *persistent* on-disk kind whose entries are NBT compounds. The client then reads the biome value varint as the start of a tag, the whole column decodes to nonsense, and it drops the join at world generation - the last thing standing between a real client and spawning. The section is now `01` (single value, network flag set) plus the biome value per sub chunk, one sub chunk for every one of the client's twenty-four, then the border byte, checked by decoding the packet the server sends and confirming it is consumed to the last byte. This too was invisible to the server's own client, which never deserialized terrain.

**The packets the client actually sends were wrong at 2168, and are right now.** The 2168 work was checked with this repository's own client, which reads `StartGame` partially, moves with `MovePlayerPacket` and never touches an inventory - so nothing exercised the paths a real client takes, and several of those had drifted years earlier:

- `StartGamePacket` still wrote a movement mode in front of the movement settings. That field left the protocol at 1.21.90, when client authoritative movement was retired, and every field after it went out one byte late. The full layout is now modelled in `@jsprismarine/protocol` and checked by decoding the packet BDS 1.26.51 sends and writing it back byte for byte.
- A real client moves with `PlayerAuthInputPacket`, every tick, and has since 1.21.80; the server had no decoder for it, so a real player could not move, and neither could they break a block, because a survival break rides in that packet's block actions. Both are read now and go through the same code as `MovePlayer` and `PlayerAction` do.
- `InventoryTransactionPacket` was read in its 748 layout: no presence byte before the legacy slot list, window ids and flags inferred rather than read, and no `Hand`, which 2193 added. `ItemStackRequestPacket` likewise: an action's selector, the four fixed bytes of a stack net id, the client's own descriptor form for auto-craft ingredients. `ItemStackResponsePacket` wrote none of its three optionals. All three follow gophertunnel's 2193 encoding now, with tests that write the bytes by hand.
- Block positions in `PlayerActionPacket` were read with an unsigned y, the layout up to 1.26.0; a block below sea level came out in the billions.

`PlaySoundPacket` gained the loop count, the range bypass and the two optionals 1.26.50 added, and can be encoded at all. `BuildPlatform` lost its retired members, `UWP` among them: BDS validates a login against the list now and refuses the value the client used to report, so it reports `WIN32`.

**The datagen reads Mojang's new publications.** `enums.html` is gone; a release is a `metadata.zip` of JSON schemas attached to a GitHub release, and the schemas list an enum's members without their values. `import-schemas.js` pins two releases - the target for the members, the first later preview whose schemas carry `x-enum-binary-value` for the numbers - into `snapshot/enums.json`, which `generate-enums.js` prefers over the old HTML dump wherever the schemas describe an enum. `DisconnectReason` and `PlayerAuthInputData` are generated from them. The recipe generator reads the `.brarchive` files a 1.26.50 server packs its behaviour packs into, and the palette capture places every block in four settings so that none pops before the save.

One thing this release cannot fix: BDS 1.26.51 defaults to `transport=nethernet` and prints that RakNet is no longer a supported transport for players. This server speaks RakNet only. Whether a 1.26.51 client still connects to a RakNet server by address is not something this repository can test.
